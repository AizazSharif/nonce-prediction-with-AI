# nonce-prediction-with-AI

A python-based code that implements the Regression model in neural networks to predict Nonce/Proof value required in calculating target hash during mining. The model is built using Pytorch Deep Learning framework.

## Dataset

The dataset is acquired from [here](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl). 

## Installation and Usage

* Install 
  * torch
